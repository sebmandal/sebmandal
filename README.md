ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

### Introduction

Software engineer and designer turned professional vibe coder (with a focus on writing *good* code)

I love [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and [SOC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/separation-of-concerns-soc/). Writing scalable code shouldn't decelerate shipping time â€” if it does, you're doing it wrong

### Stack

Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn and Prisma. Used to do Python and Java. Still fluent in AOTA and all syntax is learnable

Diehard fan of Figma, but it doesn't cloud my judgment â€” I will use the best technology situationally

### Doing

Chairman of [Mandal Group](https://www.mandal.group)

Shipping AI products at [Aien Research](https://www.aien.no) ðŸš€

### Languages

Native in English and Norwegian, passively learning other languages

### Communication

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebmandal/)

I genuinely love using [email](mailto:sebastian@mandal.group)
