👋 Hey there

### Introduction

Software engineer and designer turned professional vibe coder (with a focus on writing *good* code)

I love [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and [SoC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/separation-of-concerns-soc/). Writing scalable code shouldn't decelerate shipping time — if it does, you're doing it wrong

### Stack

Node, Express, Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn and Prisma. Used to do Python and Java. Agnostic to language tho

Diehard fan of Figma, but I will use the best technology depending on the situation

### Doing

Chairman of [Mandal Group](https://www.mandal.group) and co-founder of [Cohr](https://cohr.no)

Shipping AI products — Send a message, let's make something!

### Languages

Native in English and Norwegian, passively learning other languages

### Communication

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebmandal/)

I genuinely love using [email](mailto:sebastian@mandal.group)
