# Sebastian Pritchard-Davies Mandal
Howdy there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a full-stack developer. (or at least trying to be) 
I started by watching 6/10/12-hour videos about Python, and then started reading documentation and experimenting by myself.
I've found a love for web development, but I'm flexible and always wanting to learn new things!
You can check out more at **[my website](https://sebmandal.com)**.

## Primary Languages (what I do most and my expertises)
- Javascript (node.js, Express, etc.)
- Typescript
- Anything web related
- Python (I don't do much with Python, but I'm decent at it)
- I can easily adapt however, so any language requested should be fine! :)

## Tools
### Browser/IDE/Text editor
- Safari and Chrome (depending on OS)
- VSC / IntelliJ / Whatever shall suffice
### My primary tools:
- MacBook
### My secondary tools (in case my MacBook doesn't work):
- Dell XPS 15
- iPhone 12PM (yes I have both a compiler and text/file editor on my phone)
