🙋🏻‍♂️ Hey there, welcome to my GitHub page!
========================================

My name is Sebastian Mandal, I'm a 16-year-old passionate and self-taught full-stack web developer from Norway.

I'm currently studying [IT and media production at Akademiet Sundland](https://www.akademiet.no/vgs/utdanningsprogram/informasjonsteknologi-og-medieproduksjon/).

🖥 Current projects

* [tebone](https://github.com/sebmandal/tebone) - A TypeScript Express web framework making it easier than ever to add Express routes and build web apps.
* [Mando](https://github.com/sebmandal/mando) - A Discord utility bot written in TypeScript with developers in mind, built in a similar fashion to tebone.
* [My website](https://sebmandal.com) - Built using my tebone framework. Git repo: [sebmandal/web](https://github.com/sebmandal/web) - [live dev website updates](https://dev.sebmandal.com)

🌠 Future Projects
===================
* A React and Express finance web application written in Typescript (to learn and get accustomed to React)
* Way more open-source projects and contributions to other open-source communities and developers.
* Go full throttle on my business. To follow my lifelong dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur and CEO. This is a few years into the future still.

🗣 Primary Languages
====================

* ⭐︎ Typescript
* Javascript (Node.js and [vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/))

* I can easily adapt however, so any language should be fine on a project
