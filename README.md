Howdy there! Welcome to my GitHub!

## On-going/current Projects
### Public
- **[My personal website](https://sebmandal.com)** - My resume/CV/about me website

- **[Coding Crew](https://discord.gg/6Y93Gwd)** - I founded a Discord server called **Coding Crew** alongside @Tycrek, this server's purpose is to help out any coder's problems, finding teams for projects, collaborating, and simply just having a fun place for coders to be.
